Bug Write-Up
-------------

After examining the code in CardInterface.kt and UserCard.kt, we saw that the backend is not
validating the the user before the cards is being used.

POC
---

To verify this we logged in as the user 'ra3717_1' and bought a couple of cards. We also created
another user 'ra3717_2' and bought a card.

Then I logged in using the curl as the 'ra3717_1' use and fetched all the cards.

We got the 2 cards that we have bought with the respective card IDs. The card IDs for the cards are
191 and 192. We also fetch the card ID of the cards bought by the user 'ra3717_2'. The card ID for
'ra3717_2' is 193.

Now using the Authorization Token of user 'ra3717_1' we tried to use the card with card ID 193 that
belongs to the user 'ra3717_2'.

We made following PUT request to the /api/use/{card_no} API

====================================================================================================

We can see in the response that the "used" field in the card is True now and on the android app the
card is no longer available for the user 'ra3717_2' to use to purchase products.

Explanation of bug
-------------------

This bug arose as there is no validation that the card requested by user for usage actually belongs
to the user. This way any valid user can use a cards that belong to other user.

Fix for the bug
----------------

This bug cannot be fixed at the application end (client side) as this is a backend API issue. The
solution is that the logic behind the /api/use/{card_no} should check whether the {card_no} belong
to the user who requested the card usage.

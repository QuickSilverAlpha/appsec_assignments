1) What are the two types of Intents?
A. There are two different types of intents:

    a) Implicit Intent: This intent is a broadcast to all the elements that can handle that intent.
    The intent specifies the request details, components and other information sufficient enough for
    the system to determine all the components that can handle the intent.

    b) Explicit Intent: These intents a specified components that is set via setComponent, setClass,
    etc. These won't have additional details as the mentioned component is capable enough to handle
    the intent. This provides a simple way to perform various internal activities.

2) Which of the two types of Intents is (generally) more secure?
A. Generally, the explicit intents are more secure as we exactly know which components are specified
to handle the intents. Also, explicit provides us better flow-control of the code and handle the
intents in the best way possible. This way we also have trusted and verified intents handled by
trusted components.

3) What type of Intent is shown on lines 69 to 73 of SecondFragment.kt?
A. The Intent used in SecondFragment.kt is an implicit intent. We can see that the intent is
Intent.ACTION_VIEW that calls for an action with no explicit mention via setComponent etc. and
there is bunch of other information like type and data that is provided for the system to handle the
intent.

4) What type of Intent is shown on lines 68 to 70 of ThirdFragment.kt?
A. The Intent used here in ThirdFragment.kt is the explicit intent. We can see that the intent
explicitly uses the ProductScrollingActivity class that is the part of the internal application.

5) Which of these two Intents is the proper way to do an Intent?
A. In most of the scenarios, the explicit intent is adequate enough and hence the proper way to do
an Intent. These also gives us better flow control and makes it secure. However, there may be some
use cases where we don't know which activity can handle our request. So, in cases such as these we
may have to use implicit intents as they provide more flexibility.

-> As the last question above hinted, one of these two Intents is not correct. Fix the incorrect
Intent, then in 3 sentences or less discuss in difference.txt which file you modified and why.

We saw that the Intent in the SecondFragment.kt is an Implicit Intent. We know based on the
reasoning above the implicit intents are less secure. So, we have changed this to an Explicit Intent
as we know that the internal ProductScrollingActivity Class can handle this Intent. So, we
explicitly specify the class like it is done in the ThirdFragment.kt.

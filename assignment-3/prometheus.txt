PROMETHEUS WRITE-UP
--------------------

Part 2.1: Remove unwanted monitoring
-------------------------------------

In the GiftcardSite/LegacySite/views.py file, under register_view() function, we see a counter created for each 
password that is created by the name of counter_{password}, trying to track what passwords are being used by 
the users. This is unwanted tracking and we removed/ commencted this tracking. There are better ways to track the 
suggested usecase. This just exposes all the passwords on the Prometheus UI.


Part 2.2: Expand reasonable monitoring
---------------------------------------

To add monitoring for HTTP 404 messages we added a prometheus_client Counter named database_error_return_404. The 
following line is added in the GiftcardSite/LegacySite/views.py: 

graphs['404_counter'] = Counter('database_error_return_404', 'The total number'\
  + ' of HTTP 404 on the website')

We also added the graphs['404_counter'].inc() to increment the counter wherever the 404 Error is returned in the 
views.py so that we can properly track the 404 DB errors.

Part 2.3: Add Prometheus
-------------------------

To add Prometheus, we had to add helm, first. We added the helm from the Ubuntu package manager by adding the helm 
package manager in the sources.list. We, then used the helm to install the Prometheus. The following command is 
used:

helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus

We used the kubectl configmaps to edit the yaml file to include a new job called proxy-service under the scrape_configs 
that targets -> proxy-service:8080

    - job_name: proxy-service
      static_configs:
      - targets: ["proxy-service:8080"]

We persisted these changes in the prometheus-proxy-server.yaml file by using the the following command:

   kubectl get configmap prometheus-server -o yaml > prometheus-proxy-server.yaml

We can use this prometheus-proxy-server.yaml for the next time when we start prometheus via helm.

Once these changes were made, we could see the all the counters under different graphs on the Prometheus UI. We were 
also able to verfiy these counts on the /metrics page on the Giftcard website.
